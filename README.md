# About the course

[Udemy Course: Node.js - Creando API con Express y MongoDB (Incl. Deno)
](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-guia-desde-cero/learn/lecture/16786666?start=0#overview)

This course will give you practical knowledge so that you can immediately use Node technology for your projects, showing you the correct way to create applications on the server side (Back-End) and test them through the communication APIs between client and server. . It will cover the following sections in detail:

* Node.js basic concepts, we explain a little history of Node and how this technology that is in high demand today emerged.

* Introduction to the new features of EcmaScript, necessary to be able to put these features into practice when creating the API call.

* Sending requests and responses with the server, where we are going to build the routes that our server will understand, and therefore provide the responses to these requests.

* Use the Express.js Framework, the most used to create applications with Node.js.

* Management of MongoDB, the NoSQL database most used today by application developers, to create applications with fast responses.

* Use Mongoose to work with MongoDB, the package that is integrated into Node.js to be able to interact our data models between our code and the MongoDB database.

* Integrate Express, Mongoose and MongoDB, we integrate all technologies to create a powerful Rest API.

* User authentication, as part of the security of any Rest API, it is necessary to know and authenticate our users.

* Relationships in MongoDB, as in relational databases, there are also techniques to relate our NoSQL type databases.

* Deploy your app on Heroku, put your Rest API into production on a real server.

* We've added an introductory section to DENO, the new server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
